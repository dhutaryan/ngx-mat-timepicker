It's based on <code class="ngde">@angular/material</code> and uses features from it.</p><h2 id="motivation" href="what-is" headinglink="true" class="ngde">Motivation<ng-doc-heading-anchor class="ng-doc-anchor ngde" anchor="motivation"></ng-doc-heading-anchor></h2><p class="ngde">While working on some projects I needed to add a field with time choosing. As I used <code class="ngde">@angular/material</code> it should be compatible with that by functionality and design. Unfortunately, a lot of libraries were out of date, had not the best UI or thier functionality didn't suit my project, had some bugs. I could choose from literally 2 libraries and none of them satisfied me completelly.</p><p class="ngde">I won't talk about exact libraries, some of them you might know. In my understanding, <code class="ngde">ngx-mat-timepicker</code> should use <code class="ngde">@angular/material</code> ecosystem, features and themization, suits <a href="https://m3.material.io/" class="ngde">material design</a> as much as possible. It should give the impression that it's part of <code class="ngde">@angular/material</code> but not a separate library. So, good UX and DX were the goal.</p><p class="ngde">Hence, the desire to create a library that would correspond all these criterias above, with intuitive integration with the project and good customization.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work" href="what-is" headinglink="true" class="ngde">How does it work?<ng-doc-heading-anchor class="ng-doc-anchor ngde" anchor="how-does-it-work"></ng-doc-heading-anchor></h2><p class="ngde">ngx-mat-timepicker contains module with all necessary components and another module with time adapter (uses native JS date under the hood). Adapter is used to unify the work with time. You can create your own adapter with any library to handle time.</p><p class="ngde">You have to import both modules, add theme style and use it by the same way as you use <code class="ngde">mat-datepicker</code>.
